        <strong>Why E-Commerce is important?</strong>
        <ul style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "24px" }}>
          <li>
            So, what exactly is the significance of E-Commerce? Because it is a
            rapidly expanding consumer outlet that shows no signs of slowing
            down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cost-Effective :</b>A physical product store necessitates
            significant additional costs for management and operation. As a
            result, an E-Commerce site is the answer to every problem. It is a
            more cost-effective method of selling retail products.
          </li>
          <li>
            An E-Commerce business model differs from others in that it provides
            you with easy access, such as
          </li>
          <li> You will save a lot of money on advertising.</li>
          <li> Save money on real estate and location upkeep.</li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            Save your time whenever possible so that you can focus on product
            development and customer satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li> Less manpower is required to maintain</li>
          <li> Reduced business operating expenses</li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Gain a Competitive Advantage:</dfn>If you sell consumer goods
            in a physical store and want to increase sales and revenue, you can
            convert your physical store into a virtual one. It will assist you
            in maintaining positive business growth and outranking your
            competitors. As a result, you can reach your target audience and
            grow your business while keeping the needs and desires of your
            customers in mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increase Your Exposure:</b>Reaching out to your customers is what
            is meant by outreach. With the growing number of internet users,
            millions of people can now visit your website at any time and from
            any location. Eventually, the prospect of expanding the business
            grew. You now have complete control over getting your products to
            more people. More leads and, eventually, more new customers are the
            result of effective outreach.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, you can attract more new customers by utilising:
          </li>
          <li>The outcomes of a search engine</li>
          <li>Social exchange</li>
        </ul>
