              Biometrics technology is used to register, verify, and
              authenticate a person based on his or her physical
              characteristics, which are unique to each individual. Innovative
              biometrics-based devices provide a secure solution that cannot be
              stolen, lost, or forgotten, making biometrics crucial in human
              resource management.

              Voice patterns, hand measurements, and iris patterns are just a
              few of the characteristics that biometric technologies can analyse
              and measure. These characteristics are then compared to the stored
              characteristics of the individual attempting to gain access to a
              building or network; this system enables accurate identification
              of an individual's identity down to the smallest detail. This type
              of technology enables accurate identification of employees,
              thereby preventing workplace fraud and theft.

              Various organisations and businesses are expanding globally,
              breaking down geographical barriers. To overcome the challenges
              faced by HR professionals, such organisations, enterprises, or
              businesses must be aware of the issues encountered in monitoring
