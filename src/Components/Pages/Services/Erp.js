            <p className="cont_para_style">
              Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are software systems
              that aid in the planning, administration, and optimisation of
              internal business processes such as manufacturing, supply chain,
              financials, customer relationship management, human resources, and
              warehouse management. A typical ERP software integrates an
              organization's data and processes into a single unified system
              with the help of these solutions.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Preparation for implementation:</b> The first stage of our
                development process includes consulting, determining the scope
                of the project, the number of modules required, and so on. We
                begin by thoroughly understanding and analysing your
                organization's strategy and existing business processes before
                recommending an ERP solution tailored to your specific needs and
                requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Configuration:</b> We proceed with the design of your ERP
                system. We typically use a two-tier development approach, which
                means we create ERP software with two levels: corporate and
                subsidiary (department). In this way, each department remains
                autonomous, focusing on its core business operations, while also
                being integrated into a single system.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Customization:</b> We provide such configuration options that
                incorporate your business rules and practises in order to
                deliver the most appropriate ERP feature set. When you customise
                your ERP software, you maintain your competitive advantage over
                organisations that use standard ERP functionality.
