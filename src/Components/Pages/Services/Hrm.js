              Responsibilities of human resources management:

            <p className="cont_para_style">
              Human resource management has an impact on many internal business
              aspects. From staffing and retention to establishing workplace
              policies and regulatory compliance. In fact, any department that
              includes or interacts with employees is automatically included in
              HRM.
            </p>
            <p className="cont_para_style">
              Human Resources Management (HRM) activities include determining
              what staffing needs to be met and whether to use independent
              contractors or hire employees to meet these needs, recruiting and
              training the best employees, ensuring they are high performers,
              dealing with performance issues, and ensuring your personnel and
              management practises are in compliance with various regulations.
              Employee benefits and compensation, employee records, and
              personnel policies are all activities to manage.

                <b>HR in a small business:</b> In a small business, HR is less
                likely to be a full-fledged department and may instead be
                handled by a single employee or an outside consultant. Many
                small business owners and managers will incorporate aspects of
                human resources into their roles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>HR in a growing business:</b>Growing businesses may be
                classified as SME (small/medium enterprise). Because SMEs can
                have up to 200 employees, HR departments will almost certainly
                include both managers and administrative personnel. HR
                departments in companies that are focused on growth will most
                likely have a lot of recruitment, onboarding, and staff training
                work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>HR in a large enterprise:</b>On a larger scale, HR could be a
                sizable team in and of itself. HR departments in large
                corporations can be divided into specialty areas such as
                recruitment, employee training, and workplace safety, with full
                teams in charge of each.
